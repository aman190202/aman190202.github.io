I led a small student-run community in India for over three years, where I aimed to create an academic pathway for students aspiring to pursue research or excel in computer science. 
My college experience began amid the COVID-19 hysteria—followed by countless Coursera courses, months of cold emails, and a lot of confusion—all of which somehow led me to where I am today - so this blog 
won't be about any of my regrets.
<br></br>
After spending a few months in San Francisco, surrounded by some of the world’s most talented startup founders and engineers, and completing a year at Brown University studying Graphics, 
Vision, and Machine Learning, my perspectives have shifted significantly. Over the past year, I’ve advised dozens of students at SRM and across India on how to navigate their paths. 
This article is my attempt to summarize everything—an honest reflection on how I would re-do my Bachelor’s at SRM.
<br></br>
<h2>Freshman Year</h2>
I was fortunate enough to have begun programming in C when I was in high-school, so I had a good amount of CS and OOPS fundamentals up my hand when I begun college. Nonetheless a huge percentile of students
who enrolled with me didn't have any background with programming or systems. <b> I won't wait for the college curriculm to teach me how to program</b>. To begin with a blank background in CS can be a 
blessing in disguise - start with strong basic fundamentals and rise your way up. If you ever played Clash of Clans, you would know rushing your base in early town hall levels
would give you a tough time when you rise to Town Hall lvl 7 and above - the same applies to your CS Education.

<ul>

    I would begin with <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu">The Missing Chapter of Your CS Education</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a Windows machine, install WSL immediately.</li>
      <li>Get comfortable using WSL.</li>
      <li>Learn Vim. Use Vim.</li>
      <li>Avoid using your mouse or trackpad as much as possible.</li>
      <li>Do not install Cursor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the system you work on - get into Computer Systems.
