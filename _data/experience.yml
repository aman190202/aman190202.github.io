  title: "Research Intern : Integrated NeRF-Capture into Zip-NeRF"
  description : Integrated <a href="https://github.com/jc211/NeRFCapture"> NeRFCapture</a>, an app that use Apple's ARKit to computer poses of photos simultaneously as they captured, into the (unofficial) <a href="https://github.com/SuLvXiangXin/zipnerf-pytorch">Zip-NeRF</a> pipeline to study accuracy of pre-computed poses over COLMAP and attempting to reduce entire pre-processing time to over 50%.
